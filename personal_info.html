        <h1>Personal Info</h1>
        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Victor, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Petroleum Engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Kakinada (JNTUK). Itâ€™s a field Iâ€™m really passionate about because energy plays such an important role in powering the world, and I want to be a part of that. JNTUK has been a great place for me to learn and grow, and itâ€™s helping me build a strong foundation in engineering.

            <br>Iâ€™m from Dangeru, a beautiful and peaceful village in K. Gangavaram Mandal, Andhra Pradesh. Growing up there has given me a lot of values, like staying grounded, working hard, and being connected to my roots. My family is a big part of my life too. Weâ€™re a small, close-knit family of four, and theyâ€™ve always been there for me, supporting me through everything. Theyâ€™ve taught me the importance of unity and always believing in myself.

            <br><br>Recently, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try something new by enrolling in the CS50 course from Harvard University on the edX platform. Itâ€™s one of the best introductions to computer science, and itâ€™s been such an exciting journey so far. This course is teaching me programming, algorithms, and a lot more, which I believe are essential skills in todayâ€™s world.

            <br><br>As part of this course, Iâ€™m also working on building my own website, which is a completely new experience for me. This project is helping me apply what Iâ€™m learning and explore my creative side. Itâ€™s challenging, but I love how itâ€™s pushing me to learn and grow in ways I never imagined.

           <br><br> Even though my main focus is on petroleum engineering, Iâ€™ve realized the importance of technology in every field. Learning computer science has been an eye-opener, and Iâ€™m excited about how I can combine these skills in the future. I believe this combination will help me stay ahead and make a bigger impact.

            <br><br>Growing up in Dangeru, Iâ€™ve always felt a deep connection to my community. Itâ€™s important to me to give back in any way I can, whether itâ€™s through education, inspiring others, or helping solve local problems. My background has shaped who I am today, and I hope to use what Iâ€™ve learned to make a difference.

            <br><br>Looking ahead, I see myself as someone who can bring together knowledge from different fieldsâ€”whether itâ€™s solving complex problems in petroleum engineering, creating innovative software solutions, or contributing to society in meaningful ways. I believe that education and curiosity can open doors to endless possibilities, and I want to keep exploring and growing.

            <br>Thatâ€™s a little about me! Thank you for listening to my story, and I hope to connect with all of you and learn from your experiences too.</p>
